# deck-of-cards
This is a Java API for making card games with decks of cards. You will need some version of JDK (this was programmed on OpenJDK 11, but you know how this kind of thing works).

To compile all the files, enter `make all` while in the directory. To clean up the directory to its initial state, enter `make clean`.
